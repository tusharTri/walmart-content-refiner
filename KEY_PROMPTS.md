**Walmart Content Refiner v3.0**

## 🎯 **Strategic Development Prompts**

### **1. Foundation Building**
```
"Build a Walmart Content Refiner project with specific technical requirements and business rules. The core goal is to take product data (brand, product_type, attributes, current_description, current_bullets) from a CSV, refine it according to Walmart's compliance guardrails, and output a new CSV with refined content and a list of any violations."

Follow-up: "Create a new repo with specified folder structure and initial files. Set up proper git remote and commit with structured approach."

Architecture: "Build FastAPI endpoints first, then add Pydantic models, then implement services layer."
```
**Strategy:** Start with comprehensive requirements before coding.

---

### **2. Compliance Optimization**
```
Quality Focus: "Adjust the prompt to strictly adhere to all rules: Walmart-safe title, HTML key features (<ul><li>), description (120–160 words), meta title (≤70 chars), meta description (≤160 chars). Hard rules: no banned words, bullets ≤85 chars, 8 bullets, keep brand name, preserve & naturally insert given keywords, no medical claims."

Iteration Strategy: "Keep retrying till all points are validated and AI says 100% adherence is achieved."

Validation Approach: "Build comprehensive validation with detailed feedback for each rule violation."
```
**Strategy:** Make compliance the primary focus before optimization.

---

### **3. Token Efficiency**
```
"Man, no I am out of limit why can you comply the complete 100% grading in a single prompt make it as long as you can make it give examples verify and make 100% working in single prompt"
```
**Strategy:** Optimize for single-prompt compliance when API limits hit.

---

### **4. Iterative Learning System**
```
"See it should be like: Gemini creates a response → goes into response validator and current violation is saved, then Gemini is given prompt with those violations pointing that these are to be fixed in addition to the main rules, then again we get a response, check for violations and so on 2-3 times and once we get the response with minimum violation is to be returned along with the violation."
```
**Strategy:** Build AI systems that learn from their own mistakes.

---

### **5. Hybrid Intelligence**
```
"Revert it as I don't want to hard code, let's do it like: gen result, check for violations and save it, postprocess and give it back to Gemini stating that I have to remove these manually due to violation now make the remaining thing natural without violating again and retry if violation remains along with saving violation and return the best one"
```
**Strategy:** Combine AI creativity with programmatic precision.

---

### **6. Adaptive Problem Solving**
```
Initial Baseline: "First build a rule-based keyword integration system as a baseline"
↓
API Integration: "Now integrate Gemini API for intelligent content generation"
↓
Cost Optimization: "I'm hitting API limits, switch to Hugging Face for cost efficiency"
↓
Adaptive Response: "Hugging Face giving 404 errors, implement intelligent fallback system"
↓
Strategic Pivot: "Use the best free model available, but maintain quality standards"
```
**Strategy:** Continuously adapt when external dependencies fail while maintaining quality.

### **7. Strategic Progression**
```
Phase 1: "Build rule-based baseline first - keyword integration, content templates"
↓
Phase 2: "Add AI layer - Gemini API with advanced prompting"
↓
Phase 3: "Optimize for efficiency - reduce API calls, improve prompts"
↓
Phase 4: "Add fallbacks - Hugging Face, rule-based alternatives"
↓
Phase 5: "Hybrid approach - AI generation + programmatic fixes"
↓
Phase 6: "Final optimization - 95% compliance in 2-3 attempts"
```
**Strategy:** Progressive complexity with continuous optimization.

- Rule-based backup systems

### **3. Iterative Improvement**
- Each retry learns from previous violations
- Track best results, not just latest
- Progressive refinement approach

### **4. Hybrid Intelligence**
- AI generates creative content
- Programmatic fixes handle edge cases
- Validation ensures compliance

### **5. Token Optimization**
- Comprehensive prompts reduce retries
- Smart fallbacks save API costs
- Post-processing minimizes AI calls
