**Author: Tushar Tripathi**  
**Version: 3.0**  
**Target: 100% Compliance | Achieved: 98%+ Compliance with 3 Retries Max**

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**
Built a sophisticated AI-powered content refinement system that transforms product data into Walmart-compliant content, targeting 100% adherence to strict business rules with current achievement of 98%+ compliance in maximum 3 attempts per product.

---

## üß† **Intelligent AI-Assisted Development Approach**

### **Phase 1: Strategic Foundation (Day 1)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Build a complete system architecture first, then iterate"*

```
Initial Strategic Request: "Build a Walmart Content Refiner project with specific technical requirements and business rules. The core goal is to take product data (brand, product_type, attributes, current_description, current_bullets) from a CSV, refine it according to Walmart's compliance guardrails, and output a new CSV with refined content and a list of any violations."

Follow-up Strategy: "Create a new repo with specified folder structure and initial files. Set up proper git remote and commit with structured approach."

Architecture Focus: "Build FastAPI endpoints first, then add Pydantic models, then implement services layer."
```

**Intelligence:** Started with comprehensive requirements gathering and system architecture before writing any code.

**Result:** Complete project skeleton with proper folder structure, dependencies, and initial FastAPI setup.

---

### **Phase 2: Core System Development (Day 1-2)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Build modular, testable components with clear separation of concerns"*

```
Modular Design: "Create FastAPI endpoints for single product refinement and batch processing. Implement Pydantic models for type safety and validation."

Validation Strategy: "Build a validator service with all Walmart compliance rules - make it comprehensive and testable."

Error Handling Focus: "Implement proper status codes, error handling, and dependency injection for config and logger."
```

**Intelligence:** Focused on building a robust, maintainable system with proper error handling and validation.

**Result:** Solid foundation with API endpoints, data models, and comprehensive validation logic.

---

### **Phase 3: AI Integration & Prompt Engineering (Day 2)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Start with external APIs, but always have a fallback"*

```
Baseline Strategy: "First build a rule-based keyword integration system as a baseline, then enhance with AI."

AI Integration: "Implement Gemini API integration for content generation. Create advanced system prompts that enforce all compliance rules."

Fallback Planning: "Include retry logic for failed generations and always maintain rule-based fallback."
```

**Intelligence:** Implemented external AI API first, but always maintained fallback mechanisms.

**Result:** Working AI integration with sophisticated prompting and error handling.

---

### **Phase 4: Compliance Optimization (Day 2-3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Iterate on prompts until 100% compliance, then optimize for efficiency"*

```
"Adjust the prompt to strictly adhere to all rules: Walmart-safe title, HTML key features (<ul><li>), description (120‚Äì160 words), meta title (‚â§70 chars), meta description (‚â§160 chars). Hard rules: no banned words, bullets ‚â§85 chars, 8 bullets, keep brand name, preserve & naturally insert given keywords, no medical claims. Keep retrying till all points are validated and AI says 100% adherence is achieved."
```

**Intelligence:** Focused on prompt engineering to achieve maximum compliance before optimizing for efficiency.

**Result:** High-compliance content generation with detailed rule enforcement.

---

### **Phase 5: Efficiency Optimization (Day 3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Make the AI work smarter, not harder"*

```
"Man, no I am out of limit why can you comply the complete 100% grading in a single prompt make it as long as you can make it give examples verify and make 100% working in single prompt"
```

**Intelligence:** Recognized API token limitations and optimized for single-prompt compliance.

**Result:** Comprehensive system prompt that achieves high compliance in fewer API calls.

---

### **Phase 6: Intelligent Fallback Systems (Day 3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"When external APIs fail, build intelligent local alternatives"*

```
Initial Approach: "Build a rule-based keyword integration system first as a baseline"
‚Üì
API Integration: "Now integrate Gemini API for intelligent content generation"
‚Üì
Token Optimization: "I'm hitting API limits, switch to Hugging Face for cost efficiency"
‚Üì
Adaptive Problem Solving: "Hugging Face giving 404 errors, implement intelligent fallback system"
‚Üì
Strategic Pivot: "Use the best free model available, but maintain quality standards"
```

**Intelligence:** Continuously adapted to API limitations while maintaining functionality and quality.

**Result:** Multi-model support with intelligent fallbacks and rule-based content generation.

---

### **Phase 7: Iterative Refinement (Day 3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Build a learning system that improves with each attempt"*

```
"See it should be like: Gemini creates a response ‚Üí goes into response validator and current violation is saved, then Gemini is given prompt with those violations pointing that these are to be fixed in addition to the main rules, then again we get a response, check for violations and so on 2-3 times and once we get the response with minimum violation is to be returned along with the violation."
```

**Intelligence:** Designed an iterative learning system that learns from its own mistakes.

**Result:** Self-improving AI system with violation tracking and progressive refinement.

---

### **Phase 8: Advanced Prompt Engineering (Day 3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Create comprehensive prompts that ensure maximum compliance"*

```
Optimization Strategy: "Enhance prompts with more detailed descriptions to prevent violations and maintain comprehensive violation tracking across retries for continuous improvement."
```

**Intelligence:** Recognized that detailed, specific prompts reduce retries and improve compliance.

**Result:** Extremely detailed system prompts with comprehensive rule enforcement.

---

### **Phase 9: Post-Processing Intelligence (Day 3)**
**Key Prompt Strategy:** *"Combine AI creativity with programmatic precision"*

```
"Revert it as I don't want to hard code, let's do it like: gen result, check for violations and save it, postprocess and give it back to Gemini stating that I have to remove these manually due to violation now make the remaining thing natural without violating again and retry if violation remains along with saving violation and return the best one"
```

**Intelligence:** Combined AI generation with programmatic fixes for maximum efficiency.

**Result:** Hybrid approach achieving 95%+ compliance with minimal API calls.
